## Description

This project is a book search engine built using the MERN stack. It allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books, and view them later. The application has been refactored from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Visit [Book Search](https://booksearch-vrtc.onrender.com).
